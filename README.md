# Human Pose Detection through Image as well as Video

Pose Estimation is a general problem in Computer Vision where we detect the position and orientation of an object. This usually means detecting keypoint locations that describe the object.

## Models Used

- ### Common Objects in Context

The COCO keypoints include 17 different pre-trained keypoints (classes) that are annotated with three values (x,y,v). The x and y values mark the coordinates, and v indicates the visibility of the key point (visible, not visible). While image recognition systems usually perform well on such iconic views, they struggle to recognize objects in real-life scenes that show a complex scene or partially occlude the object. Hence, it is an essential aspect of the coco images that they contain natural images that contain multiple objects.

- ### Multi Person II

Human pose estimation refers to the process of inferring poses in an image. Essentially, it entails predicting the positions of a person’s joints in an image or video. This problem is also sometimes referred to as the localization of human joints. It’s also important to note that pose estimation has various sub-tasks such as single pose estimation, estimating poses in an image with many people, estimating poses in crowded places, and estimating poses in videos.
